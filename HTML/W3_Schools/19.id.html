    <p>
        The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element.
        <br>The id attribute is used to point to a specific style declaration in a style sheet. It is also used by JavaScript to access and manipulate the element with the specific id.
        <br>The syntax for id is: write a hash character (#), followed by an id name. Then, define the CSS properties within curly braces {}.
        <br>Below is an example of a header in which a specific ID has been applied.

    <h3><ins>HTML Bookmarks with ID and Links.</ins></h3>
    <p>
        HTML bookmarks are used to allow readers to jump to specific parts of a webpage.
        <br>Bookmarks are majorly important when you have a very long webpage.
        <br>First create a bookmark with the <b>id</b> attribute:<br><br>
        <img src="Images/IdCreate.jpg" alt="Creation" width="300" height="100">
        <br>Then after that, add a link to the bookmark:
        <br><br>
        <img src="Images/Link2Bookmark.jpg" alt="Link Creation" width="300" height="100">
    </p>
</body>
