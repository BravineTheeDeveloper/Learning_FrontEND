        The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element.
        <br>The id attribute is used to point to a specific style declaration in a style sheet. It is also used by JavaScript to access and manipulate the element with the specific id.
        <br>The syntax for id is: write a hash character (#), followed by an id name. Then, define the CSS properties within curly braces {}.
        <br>Below is an example of a header in which a specific ID has been applied.
