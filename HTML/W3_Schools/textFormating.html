        <h3>TEXT FORMATTING</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
            HTML contains several elements for defining text with a special meaning.
            <br>Formatting elements were designed to display special types of texts like:
            <hr>
            <br><b>1. The bold text is enclosed by elements {b OR strong}</b>
            <br> Examples would be:
            <br><b>Put your money where your mouth is!</b>
            <br><strong>This text was really supposed to be bold!</strong>
            <br><b>There is still a chance for my man!</b>
            <hr>
            <br><b>2. The {i and em} elements.</b>
            <br>The {i} element is used make text to be printed out as italic. Most commonly used to display a technical term or a foreign language.
            <br>Examples would be:
            <br><i>This text is Italic</i>
            <br><i>Our numbers have risen!</i>
            <br><i>Welcome home son!</i>
            <br><em>Hello screen reader!</em>
            <br><b>Note:</b> The [em] element is a bot different from the {i} element as a screen reader will pronounce the words in {em} with emphasis and using verbal stress.
            <hr>
            <br><b>3. The {small} text.</b>
            <br>This element is used to display smaller text ie.
            <br><small>This is some smaller text!</small>
            <br><small>He will not win the election.</small>
            <br><small>Why did he decide too get away like that!</small>
            <hr>
            <br><b><ins>4. The {mark} element</ins></b>
            <br>This element defines text that should be highlighted or marked.
            <br>Examples are:
            <br>Don't forget to buy <mark>Milk</mark> form the shop.
            <br>You are a <mark>gem!</mark>.
            <br>He went to steal <mark>Money </mark> from the bank!
            <hr>
            <br><b>5. The {del} element</b>
            <br> This element defines text that has been deleted from a document. Browsers will usually strike a line through deleted text.
            <br>Examples:
            <br>My favorite color is <del>blue</del> red.
            <br>I will try visiting on <del>Monday</del> Tuesday.
            <br>i will come along with a <del>book</del> paper.
            <hr>
            <br><b>6. The {ins} element</b>
            <br>It defines a text that has been inserted into a document. Browsers will usually underline inserted text.
            <br>Examples are:
            <br>My favorite color is <ins>RED</ins>
            <br>I am the <ins>LEADER</ins> of this organization.
            <br>let us get the <ins>PAPERWORK</ins> done.
            <hr>
            <br><b><ins>7. The {sub} and the {sup} element</ins></b>
            <br>The {sup} element defines superscript text. Superscript text appears half a character above the normal line, and is sometimes rendered in a smaller font.
            <br>Examples could be:
            <br>
