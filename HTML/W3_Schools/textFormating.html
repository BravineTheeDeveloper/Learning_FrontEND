        <hr>
        <p>
            HTML contains several elements for defining text with a special meaning.
            <br>Formatting elements were designed to display special types of texts like:
            <br>1. The bold text os enclosed by elements {b OR strong}
            <br> Examples would be:
            <br><b>Put your money where your mouth is!</b>
            <br><strong>This text was really supposed to be bold!</strong>
            <br><b>There is still a chance for my man!</b>
        </p>
