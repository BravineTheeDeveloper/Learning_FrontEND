        <h2>HTML PARAGRAPHS</h2>
        <P>
            A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.
            <br>With HTML, you cannot change the display by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code.
            <br>The browser will automatically remove any extra spaces and lines when the page is displayed.
        </P>
