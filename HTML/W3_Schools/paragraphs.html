        <h2>HTML PARAGRAPHS</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.
            <br>With HTML, you cannot change the display by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code.
            <br>The browser will automatically remove any extra spaces and lines when the page is displayed.
        </p>

        <h3>1. Horizontal Rules</h3>
        <p>
            The <b>hr</b> tag defines a thematic break in a HTML page and is often used to display a horizontal line
            The "hr" tag is an empty tag and that means it does not have a closing tag.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            When writing something like a poem in HTML,we use the {pre} element (enclosed in angle brackets ).
            <br>The text inside a {pre} element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks.
            <br>The next paragraph illustrates it.
        </p>

            My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
            My Bonnie lies ove the sea.
            My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
            Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
        </pre>
