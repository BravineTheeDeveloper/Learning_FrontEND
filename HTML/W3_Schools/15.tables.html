    <h3><u>HTML Tables</u></h3>
    <p>
       HTML tables are used to display data in a way that is easy to read.
        <br>HTML tables allow developer to arrange data into rows and columns.
        <br> A Table in HTML consists of tables rows and columns.<br>
        <br>Each table cell is defined by a <b>"td"</b> and a <b>"/td"</b> tag, which has a full definition of <b>Table data</b>
        <br>Everything between the two tags are the contents of table cell.<br>
        <br>Each table row starts with a <b>"tr"</b> and ends with a <b>"/tr"</b> tag. There the <b>"tr"</b> stands for table rows. The more the number of <b>"tr"</b> opening tags, the more the rows will there be in the specific table.
        <br>You can have as many rows as you like in a table; just make sure that the number of cells are the same in each row.
        <br>example could be:
    </p>
    <table style="width: 100%;">
        <tr>
            <td>Blogging</td>
            <td>Securing</td>
            <td>Ushering</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
        Sometimes you want your cells to be table header cells. In those cases use the <b>th</b> tag instead of the <b>td</b> tag.
        <br><b>th</b> basically stands for table headers.
    </p>
    <table style="width: 100%;">
        <tr>
            <th>Person 1</th>
            <th>Person 2</th>
            <th>Person 3</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>John</td>
            <td>Mike</td>
            <td>Bob</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>16</td>
            <td>14</td>
            <td>10</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
        By default, the text in <b>Table header</b> elements are bold and centered, but you can change that with CSS.
