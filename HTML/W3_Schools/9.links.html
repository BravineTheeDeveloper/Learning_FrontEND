        The HTML <b>(a)</b> tag defines a hyperlink. It has the following syntax:
        <br><b>{href="url">link text}</b>. This is placed inside the <b>a</b> tag.
        <br>The most important attribute of the <b>"a"</b> element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination.
        <br>The <b><i>link text</i></b> is the part that will be visible to the reader.
    </p>

    <h4><ins>The Target attribute</ins></h4>
    <p>
        By default, the linked page will be displayed in the current browser window. To change this, you must specify another <b>target</b> for the link.
        <br>The <b>target</b> attribute specifies where to open the linked document. It can have the following values:
        <blockquote>
            1. <b> _self</b> - Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked<br>
            2. <b>_blank</b> - Opens the document in anew window or tab.<br>
            3. <b>_parent</b> - Opens the document in the parent frame.<br>
            4. <b>_top</b> - Opens the document in the full body of the window
        </blockquote>
        A good example would be: <a href="https://twitter.com/home" target="_blank"> Twitter HomePage</a>
        <br>A good example would be: <a href="https://twitter.com/home" target="_self"> Twitter HomePage</a>
        <br>A good example would be: <a href="https://twitter.com/home" target="_parent"> Twitter HomePage</a>
        <br>A good example would be: <a href="https://twitter.com/home" target="_top"> Twitter HomePage</a>

    <h3><ins>Link Colors.</ins></h3>
    <p>
        By default, a link will appear like this (in all browsers):
        <blockquote>
            1. An unvisited link is underlined in blue.<br>
            2. A visited link is underlined in purple.<br>
            3. An active link is underlined in red.
        </blockquote>
        All that however, can be hanged by CSS.
        <br> The things that get to change whenever you want to style links in HTML using CSS are: Color, background-color and text-decoration.
        <br>Here, an unvisited link will be green with no underline. A visited link will be pink with no underline. An active link will be yellow and underlined. In addition, when mousing over a link (a:hover) it will become red and underlined:
        <br>
    </p>
