            A favicon is a small image displayed next to the page title in the browser tab.
            <br>An example could be the one below on w3schools.<br>
            <img src="https://www.w3schools.com/html/img_favicon.png" alt="Favicon Image" style="width:450px; height: 50px;">
            <br>The Green "W" Icon that appears on top of the web browser picture above is what we refer to as a Favicon.
            <br><br>To add a favicon to your website, either save your favicon image to the root directory of your webserver, or create a folder in the root directory called images, and save your favicon image in this folder. A common name for a favicon image is "favicon.ico".
            <br>Next, add a <b>link</b> element to your "index.html" file, after the <b>title</b> element. This is done in the <b>"head"</b>element .<br> An eample of the syntaxt could be:
            <blockquote>
