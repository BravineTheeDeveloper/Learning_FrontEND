    <h3><u>HTML Class</u></h3>
    <p>HTML class is used to add styling to the html element.<br>
        <br>In the example bellow, we have two <b>{span}</b> elements with a class attribute with the value of "note".
        <br>Both span elements will be styled equally according to the <b>.note</b> style definition in the head section.
        <br>Example:
        <br> <img src="Images/Class.jpg" width="300" height="300">
        <br><br>The above code shows how the class and span elements are applied. Now let us apply them to a rea example bellow.
    </p>
    <h4>This is an <span class="note">Important</span> Heading.</h4>
    <p>
        The word <b>important</b> in the above heading has been highlighted in <span class="note">red</span> and its font is not same as the rest.
        <br>
        <hr>
        Basically, the class attribute can be used on any HTML element. In addition to that, the class name that you get to choose is by default case sensitive.
