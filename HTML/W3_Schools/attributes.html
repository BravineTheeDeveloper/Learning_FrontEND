        <h1>HTML Attributes</h1>
        <p>Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements.
            <br>They comprise of the "href" attribute and the "src" attribute.</p>

        <h2>1). The "href" Attribute.</h2>
        <p>The "a" tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to.
            <br>The format would be {a href="https://twitter.com/home"}, with the angle brackets at the beginning and the end.
            <br>An example could be <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">Link to W3schools</a>
            <br>Second example <a href="https://twitter.com/home">My Twitter</a>
        </p>

        <h2>2). The "src" Attribute</h2>
        <p>The "img" tag is used to embed an Image to a HTML page.
            <br>The "src" attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed.
            <br>The format would be {img src="img_girl.jpg"}, with angle brackets at the beginning and the end.<br>
            <br>There are two ways to specify the URL in the src attribute:
            <br><b>(a)Absolute URL </b><br>This is are Links to an external image that is hosted on another website.
            <br> The only disadvantage with images from external links is that you cannot control them as they can be changed or removed.
            <br>The format example could be like :{src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg".}<br>
            Here is a display example of a laptop stickers image from twitter.
            <br><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FtIpLXfWcAUdZ_n?format=jpg&name=large" width="300" height="400">
            <br><b>Relative URL</b><br>This one links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does not include the domain name.
            <br>Here, the URL does not include the domain name. If the URl begins without a forward slash, it will be relative to the current page but if it begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain name.
            <br>
