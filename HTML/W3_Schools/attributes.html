        <h1>HTML Attributes</h1>
        <p>Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements.
            <br>They comprise of the "href" attribute and the "src" attribute.</p>

        <h2>(1). The "href" Attribute.</h2>
        <p>The "a" tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to.
            <br>The format would be {a href="https://twitter.com/home"}, with the angle brackets at the beginning and the end.
            <br>An example could be <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">Link to W3schools</a>
            <br>Second example <a href="https://twitter.com/home">My Twitter</a>
        </p>

        <h2>(2). The "src" Attribute</h2>
        <p>
            The "img" tag is used to embed an Image to a HTML page.
            <br>The "src" attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed.
            <br>The format would be {img src="img_girl.jpg"}, with angle brackets at the beginning and the end.<br>
            <br>There are two ways to specify the URL in the src attribute:
            <br><b>(a)Absolute URL </b><br>This is are Links to an external image that is hosted on another website.
            <br> The only disadvantage with images from external links is that you cannot control them as they can be changed or removed.
            <br>The format example could be like :{src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg".}<br>
            Below is a display example of a laptop stickers image from twitter.<br>
            <br><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FtIpLXfWcAUdZ_n?format=jpg&name=large" width="300" height="400"> <br>
            <br><b>(b)Relative URL</b><br>This one links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does not include the domain name.
            <br>Here, the URL does not include the domain name. If the URl begins without a forward slash, it will be relative to the current page but if it begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain name.
            <br>The format without a slash would be {src="img_girl.jpg"}<br> The format with a slash would be {src="/images/img_girl.jpg"}.<br>
            <b>Note:</b> It is almost always best to use relative URLs (those without a slash). They will not break if you change domain.
        </p>

        <h2>(3). The "alt" Attributes</h2>
        <p>It comes after the <b>src</b> attribute in the <b>img</b> tag.
            <br>It specifies an alternate text for an image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed.Failure of display could be caused by a slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader.
            <br>Its format is {img src="img_girl.jpg" width="500" height="600"} closed by the angle brackets.
        </p>

        <h2>(4). The "style" Attribute</h2>
        <p>
            The <b>style</b> attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.
            <br> As an example, to change the color of text in a paragraph, immediately after the opening part of a paragraph ie {the first "p"}, inside it is where you include the style attribute to change color of the specified paragraph.
            <br>Format would be {style="color:"The desired color either red, blue or any other desired. ";"}
        </p>

        <h2>(4). The "lang" Attribute</h2>
        <p>
            You should always include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag, to declare the language of the Web page.This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.
            <br>To specify English as the language, we use {lang="en"} inside the html tag.
        </p>
