            CSS is applied through three different ways in  HTML page which are:
            <br><b>1. In line CSS</b>
            <br><b>2. Internal CSS</b>
            <br><b>3. External CSS</b>
            <br> Internal CSS has already been discussed previously and its where you are allowed to insert the CSS styles inside a HTML element/attribute.
            <br>Examples could be:{style:"color: specify"}
        </p>

            Its used to define a style for a single HTML page.
            An internal CSS is defined in the {head} section of an HTML page, within a {style} element.
