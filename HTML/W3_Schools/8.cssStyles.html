            CSS is applied through three different ways in  HTML page which are:
            <br><b>1. In line CSS</b>
            <br><b>2. Internal CSS</b>
            <br><b>3. External CSS</b><br>
            <br> Internal CSS has already been discussed previously and its where you are allowed to insert the CSS styles inside a HTML element/attribute.
            <br>Examples could be:<b>{style:"color: specify"}</b>
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h3><ins>Internal CSS</ins></h3>
        <p>
            Its used to define a style for a single HTML page.
            An internal CSS is defined in the {head} section of an HTML page, within a {style} element.
        </p>
        <h3><ins>External CSS</ins></h3>
        <p>
            An external style sheet is used to define the style for many HTML pages.
            <br>To use an external style sheet, add a link to it in the {head} section of each HTML page:
            <br>Appropriate format would be: <b>{link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css}</b>, closed inside angle brackets and contained in the <b>head</b> section of the HTML page.
            <br>The external style sheet can be written in any text editor. The file must not contain any HTML code, and must be saved with a .css extension.
        </p>

        <br>The CSS Border property defines a border around a HTML element.
        <br>The syntax look like this <b>{border: 2px solid powderblue;}</b> and its defined either in a paragraph or heading.
        <br>The CSS padding property defines a padding (space) between the text and the border.
        <br>Syntax for CSS padding is <b>{padding: 30px;}</b> and it comes immediately after the <b>Boarder</b> is declared.
