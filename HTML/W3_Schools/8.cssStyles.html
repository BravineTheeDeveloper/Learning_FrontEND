            CSS is applied through three different ways in  HTML page which are:
            <br><b>1. In line CSS</b>
            <br><b>2. Internal CSS</b>
            <br><b>3. External CSS</b><br>
            <br> Internal CSS has already been discussed previously and its where you are allowed to insert the CSS styles inside a HTML element/attribute.
            <br>Examples could be:{style:"color: specify"}
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h3><ins>Internal CSS</ins></h3>
        <p>
            Its used to define a style for a single HTML page.
            An internal CSS is defined in the {head} section of an HTML page, within a {style} element.
        </p>
        <h3><ins>External CSS</ins></h3>
        <p>
            An external style sheet is used to define the style for many HTML pages.
            <br>To use an external style sheet, add a link to it in the {head} section of each HTML page:
            <br>Appropriate format would be: {link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css}, closed inside angle brackets and contained in the Head section of the HTML page.
